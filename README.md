Smart Home System Programming Exercise

## Introduction
My name is Karaka Sri Sai Nitin & I am currently pursuing my final year in BTech in Computer Science with specializing in Cyber Security. My passion for Web Development, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AIML), and Cyber Security has driven me to work on a wide range of projects, allowing me to consistently enhance my skills and knowledge in these areas.

## About the Project - **Smart Home System Simulation**
**This repository contains the implementation of both the assigned exercises in Java.**

# Project Overview

This project involves implementing a **Smart Home System simulation** that allows users to control various smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and door locks through a central hub. The system enables users to:

- Turn devices on or off.
- Set schedules for device operation.
- Automate tasks based on triggers (e.g., turning off lights when the thermostat reaches a certain temperature).

Using object-oriented principles, the solution applies the following design patterns:

- **Observer Pattern**: Updates all devices when a change occurs in the system.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Creates different types of smart devices (lights, thermostats, door locks).
- **Proxy Pattern**: Controls access to the devices, ensuring security and management through the central hub.

This ensures modularity, encapsulation, and a strong design architecture.
