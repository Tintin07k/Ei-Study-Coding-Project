# Ei-Study-Coding-Project
Smart Home System Programming Exercise

## Introduction
My name is Karaka Sri Sai Nitin & I am pursuing my Final Year in B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering(CSE) with specialization in Cyber Security. My enthusiasm for Cyber Security, Machine Learning, and Web Development has motivated me to engage in a variety of projects, continuously expanding my expertise and honing my skills in these fields.

## About the Project - **Smart Home System Simulation**
**The repository provides the solutions for both the coding exercises developed in Java.**

### Project Overview

This project involves implementing a **Smart Home System simulation** that allows users to control various smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and door locks through a central hub. The system enables users to:

- Switch ON or OFF devices.
- Setting schedules for device operations.
- Automating Tasks based on Triggers (e.g., turning off lights when the thermostat reaches a certain temperature).

The solution utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and incorporates the following design patterns:

- **Observer Pattern**: All devices are updated automatically whenever a change is made in the system.
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Used to create different type of smart devices (lights, thermostats, door locks).
- **Proxy Pattern**: Controls access to the devices, ensuring security and management through the central hub.

This ensures modularity, encapsulation, and a strong design architecture.
